## Completed Packets

- Initial Demo – Taliesin
	- Game loop, drawing player sprites and tiles, movement
- World & Camera – Abdullah
	- Logic to work with a world map and a moving camera
- Collision - Lu
	- Creation of CollisionChecker.java, includes creation of rectangular 'hit-boxes' for everything with collision
- Objects and Object Interaction – Jonathan
	- Creation of an Object superclass, a couple of objects, and the ability to interact with them (collect keys to open doors). Objects can be placed and found on the map
- Sound integration – Abdullah
	- Inclusion of background music via creation of Sound.java, integration of sound in GamePanel.java, and groundwork for sound effects (e.g. door opening sound)
- Basic UI – Abdullah
	- Basic framework for text-based UI (displaying text on screen)
- Improved Rendering – Lu
	- Improved drawing and clean-up of rendering-related code
- Game State – Lu
	- Methods enabling pausing of the game. Includes adding a key dedicated to pausing the game (at the time of writing 'P').
- Conversion from Swing to JavaFX – Taliesin
	- Massive conversion of the project to use the JavaFX toolkit. This was caused by Taliesin's error in accidentally basing the project around Swing (not knowing the difference).
- Add Splash-screen – Jonathan
  - Add a splash screen that is shown when the game is started.
- Add basic item inventory – Jonathan 
  - Items will be displayed in miniature form at the top of the screen.
- Add NPCs – High Importance – Lu
	- Add interactable non-player entities to the game. This will be needed for future game development.
- End screen – High Importance – Jonathan
	- Much like the splash screen, we now need a screen indicating that the player has finished the demo.
	- Add a background timer that keeps track how long the player took from starting the game to ending it.
	- The end screen should display the player's time.
- Create Demo – High Importance – Taliesin
	- The time has come. Prepare a new world map and create the basics for the demo. Features must be dialog with an NPC, object interaction, and use of cuteness.
